# Cloud Functions
> Execute some code when an event happens

1. Run code in response to events
2. Pay only for what you use
3. Time bound" Default 1 min and MAX 60 minutes 
_NOT ideal for long running processes_

- They scale horizontally
- One function can handdle multiple requests AT THE SAME TIME

# Cloud run & Cloud run for anthos
> Container to production in seconds

Build on top of an open standard - *Knative*

- Request timeout: Up to 60 minutes for HTTP-triggered functions

# Best practices
- To avoid cold starts, set min no of instances (increases cost)
- Configure max no of instances (project from abnormally high request levels)
- Use Cloud endpoints (or Apiegee or API gateway) for versioning
- Use Cloud run revisions for safer releases
- Use Secret manager to securely store secrets
- Use individual service accounts for each function
- Manage dependencies using yout language specific tool
