### Planning for Scalability

- Highly  Scalable  Compute  Engine  Architecture  :  VMs  in  MIGconfigured by instance template (and load balanced with LoadBalancing)
- Use Pod and Cluster Autoscaling for GKE
- Local SSD is least scalable (Max 8 per VM)
- Persistent Disks: Can be scaled horizontally and vertically
- Compute: Cloud  Storage,  App  Engine  and  Cloud  Functions  are  serverless  (AutoScaling)
