# Storage

## Encryption

- Data at rest: Stored on a device or a backup
- Data in motion: Being transferred across a network -> Data in transit
- Data in use

**Symmetric Key Encryption**
Use the same key for encryption anddecryption

**Asymmetric Key Encryption** -> *Public Key Cyptography*
Encrypt  data  with  Public  Key  anddecrypt with Private Key

**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**
- Create and manage cryptographic keys (symetric and asymetric)
- Control their use in your applications and GC Services
- Provides an API to encryp, decrypt, or sign data

## Block Storage and File storage
- Block:
    - Persisten disks: Network block storage: Not tied to any VM
        - Independent lifecycle
        - Zonal and regional
    - Local SSDs: Tied to one VM. Cannot be detached and attah to other vm
- File
    - File storage

*Persistent Disks - Snapshots*
- Take point-in-time snapshots of your Persistent Disks
    - Can be schedule
    - Share it across projects
    - New disks and instances from snapshots
    - Are incremental: Deleting a snapshot only deletes data whitch is NOT needed by other snapshots
- Recommendations
    - Avoid taking snapshots more often than once an hour
    - Creating snapshots from disk is faster than creating from images
    - **Improve performance** -> **Increase size of PD or add more**

### File storage
File share, media workflows and content management

## Object Storage
- Serverless
- Key-value approach
- All file types
- Objects are stored in buckets -> Unlimited objects im a bucket
- Max object size is **5 T**
- Encrypts data on the server side -> Optional Client Side: Performed by customer before upload
    **Data retention policy** -> How long should objects in the bucket be retained for
        - Cannot remove policy or reduce retention period (increase yes)
        - Cannot delete the bucket

**Transfer data for on premises to cloud**
- Online trnasfer: Use gsutil - Good for >1TB
- Store Transfer Service: Large-scale (petabytes) online data - Good for <1TB
- Transfer Appliance: Physical transfer using appliance - Good for <20TB
