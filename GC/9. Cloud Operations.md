# Operations

## Cloud monitoring
Monitoring infrastructure
- Measures key aspects of services (Metrics)
- Visualizations (Graphs and Dashboard)
- Alerts
    - Alerting policies:
        - Condition
        - Notifications
        - Documentation

**Workspace** -> Organize monitoring information
**Cloud monitoring agent** on a vm to get more disk, cpu, network and process metrics

## Logging
Real time log management and analysis tool
Most services automatically send logs to Cloud Logging

Audit logs -> Answers who did that, when and where

**Logs buckets**
- Required: Holds admin activity, system events and access transperency logs (retained for 400 days)
    - Zero charge. Cannot delete or change retention
- Default: All other logs (retained for 30 days)
    - Billed based on logging pricing

Are stored for limited period. Can be exported to storage bucket, big query data set, pub/sub

## Cloud trace
Distribute tracing system. *Collect latency data*
Find out:
    - How long does a service take to handle requests
    - What is the average latency of requests?
    - How are we doing over time?

## Debugger
Capture state of a running application
Very lightweight => Very little impact to users
Can be used in any environment: Test, Acceptance, Production

## Profiler
Identify performance bottlenecks in production
Statistical, low-overhead profiler
    Gathers CPU and Memory usage from production systems

## Error reporting
Identify problems in real time:
    - Sending them to cloud logging
    - Calling error reporting API

*Record all operations/requests on all objects in abucket (for auditing)* -> Turn on data access audit logging for the bucket
