# Pub/Sub
Asynchronous communication

Create a topic and have applications put log messages on the topic
    - Decoupling: Publisher (apps) don't care about who is listening
    - Availability: Publisher (apps) up even if a suscriber (logging service) is down
    - Scalability: Scale customer instances (logging service) under high load
    - Durability: Message is not lost even if subscriber (logging service) is down

**Hig Available** and **High Scalable**
- Process billions of messages per day
- Low cost (Pay for use)

## Dataflow
Streaming and batch use cases
Serverless

(Remember)  BigQuery  queries  can  be  expensive  as  you  are running them on large data sets!
**(BEST PRACTICE) Estimate BigQuery queries before running:**
- Loading data in bulk is free but streaming data is NOT FREE

## Dataproc
- Managed spark and hadoop service: **Perform complex batch processing**
    **A DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM**
